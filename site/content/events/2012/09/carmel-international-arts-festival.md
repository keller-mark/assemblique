 Thanks to all who stopped by my booth at the Art Festival this weekend. It was interesting to meet other assemblage artists and fans, and to share ideas with all the people who enjoy seeing something different.

 Don’t forget to visit The Renaissance Fine Art & Design Gallery occasionally to see my latest pieces, as well as other fine works of art. 1 South Range Line Road, Carmel, IN 46032 • 317.506.8477

 Also, if you happen to be cleaning out your garage, basement, attic, or shed, and come across some unusual objects that might find a better home in a piece of art rather than the garbage dump, think about emailing me. I’m always interested.
