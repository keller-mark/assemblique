The mermaid is finally done! My largest piece since Ann Dromeda! Made from vintage ceramic disk capacitors (lower body), antique brass chandelier parts (tail), antique clock gears, nautilus shell, antique adding machine and typewriter parts (hair), antique camera lenses, and vintage circuit boards (face). #assemblageart #assemblique #typewriterparts #circuitboards #mermaids #nautilusshell
