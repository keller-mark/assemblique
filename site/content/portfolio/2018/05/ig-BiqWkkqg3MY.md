“Love is like Oxygen”, one of my latest pieces available this weekend at the Bethlehem PA Art Fair. Made from old electronics, antique camera lenses, an old brass oxygen gauge, vintage capacitors and resistors, and antique brass parts. #assemblique #assemblageart #antiquebrass #upcycledart #recycledparts4art #repurposedart #maskart #bethlehempa #bethlehemart
