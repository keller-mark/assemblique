Finally completed my Grasshopper commission”Blue Bird” (sorry it took so long David!) Made from old adding machine parts, some metal toy plane wings, a carved wood fish, two antique spud wrenches, two vintage glass indicator lights, some old circuit boards, parts from a vintage super8 movie camera, and some antique clock parts #bluebird #grasshoppersofinstagram #mechanicalinsects #spudwrench #tropicalfishhead #assembliquewebsite\_portfolio #assemblageart #upcycledart #recycledpartsforart #giantmetalbug
