 “Ben Grady”

 24″H x 11″W x 5″D

 Commissioned by Sheri A., made from her father’s parts. He had owned a business telephone company back in the day, and had left her many bins full of old parts, vintage electronics, etc. She asked me to use them to create some masks using his parts, and Ben Grady is the first.

 Parts include:

  * Alligator clips
 * Ceramic disk capacitors
 * vintage camera lenses,
 * cast metal eagle wing parts
 * Antique brass lamp parts
 * Hexagon key tags
 * Vintage wood and horse hair brushes
 * Vintage indicator light bulbs
  There is an LED light inside one of his eyes, the last photo shows Ben with the LED turned on.
