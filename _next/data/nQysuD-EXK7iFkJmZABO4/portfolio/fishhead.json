Sold this at my first art fair in Zionesville, IN. It’s very large, about 18″W x 32″H. I met FishHeads owners a few weeks ago at the Indie Vintage Arts show at the fairgrounds and they were nice enough to send me a photo. Thank Judy and Tom…</p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2013/05/fishhead.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2013/05/fishhead.jpg?w=430\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n","title":"“FishHead”"},"__N_SSG":true}
