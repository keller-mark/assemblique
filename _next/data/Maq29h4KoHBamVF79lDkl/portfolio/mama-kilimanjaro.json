Kilimanjaro back in 1990, the non-tourist Umbwe route, which turned into a difficult 8-day trek, one that changed my life forever.</p>\n<p> According to some, the name “Kilimanjaro” comes Kilima (Swahili for “hill, little mountain”) and Njaro, an ancient Swahili word for white or for shining. unfortunately there is very little “white” left, as most of the glaciers are disappearing.</p>\n<p> This sculpture was meant to remind us that global warming is affecting the earth in many ways, and that time is running out for this jewel of a mountain. It may not always “shine” as it once did.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-a.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-a.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-bb.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-bb.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-c.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-c.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-d.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-d.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n<p> <a href=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-ee.jpg\"><img src=\"//assemblique.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2012/03/mamakilimanjaro-ee.jpg?w=487\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p>\n","title":"Mama Kilimanjaro"},"__N_SSG":true}
