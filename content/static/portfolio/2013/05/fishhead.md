 Recently re-discovered piece that I made almost 3 years ago. Sold this at my first art fair in Zionesville, IN. It’s very large, about 18″W x 32″H. I met FishHeads owners a few weeks ago at the Indie Vintage Arts show at the fairgrounds and they were nice enough to send me a photo. Thank Judy and Tom…
