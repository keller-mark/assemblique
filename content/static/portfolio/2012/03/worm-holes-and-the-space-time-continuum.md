title: Worm Holes and the Space-Time Continuum
---

 Years ago, a friend gave me this large knot that was cut off a tree on his upstate NY land. Once I removed all the bark, there were worms that were still living in the wood, eating little tunnels in the wood, and leaving little piles of wood dust where I had left the piece to dry out. I eventually got rid of the worms, but expanded on the worm hole theme. This was NOT CARVED at all, besides the darkened grooves. The tree had grown this shape, with the “nose” and hollowed back. Added old clock & watch parts, wood is finished with tung oil.
